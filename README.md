# Siamese
Siamese (**S**calable, **i**ncremental, **a**nd **m**ulti-repr**ese**ntation) is a code clone search engine.

## Why it's good?
It works with multiple representations of source code to capture code
similarity at different structural levels and mines token frequencies in a code
corpus on-the-fly and automatically adjusts a query's length to improve the
search speed and accuracy. The tool is scalable to a corpus of hundreds million lines of code and return the results within seconds.
